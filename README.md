## AWS Opsworkscm Server Mgmt Lambda Source

aws-opsworkscm-server-mgmt sets up a pipeline that manages OpsWorks Configuration Manager server instances.  The pipeline setup code is available here: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-opsworkscm-server-mgmt

This is a repository for the three lambda functions used by the pipeline and is configured to automatically update the S3 buckets which are used by cloudformation to help stage the pipeline.
